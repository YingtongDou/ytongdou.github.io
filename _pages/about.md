## Bio
I am currently a Computer Science Ph.D. student in [Big Data and Social Computing (BDSC) Lab](https://bdsc.lab.uic.edu/) of the University of Illinois at Chicago. My supervisor is [Prof. Philip S. Yu](https://www.cs.uic.edu/PSYu/). Before joining UIC, I got my Bachelor’s Degree from the Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications and the Queen Mary University of London. My research interests are **graph mining**, **spam detection** and **social network analysis**. I am interested in designing algorithms dealing with challenging problems in social networks and applying social computing techniques into various areas.

## Working Projects
  * **Suspicious Behavior Modeling in Mobile App Markets**
  
  ![projects1](/images/proj1.png){: .align-left} **Introduction** Mobile App Markets like App Store and Google Play involves many fraudsters like spammers, botnets and crowd workers. We investigate the underground market of trading app downloads and reviews, design classifers with multi-view and multi-source information according to the intention of the fraudsters. We also want to develop scalable and robust graph based classfication models.  
  **Resources** My intro [slides](http://ytongdou.com/files/Online%Spam%Detection.pdf) about recent advance in online spam detection, Meng Jiang's [survey](http://www.meng-jiang.com/pubs/survey-suspicious-issi16/survey-suspicious-issi16-paper.pdf) on suspicious behavior modeling, Srijan Kumar's [survey](https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.08559) on online false information study. 
  * **Securing Graph-based Classfication Model**
  
  ![projects2](/images/proj2.png){: .align-left} **Introduction** The long lasting campaign between the fraudsters and online review platforms like Yelp and TripAdvisor makes the security of classifiers become very important. We aim to improve the robustness of  graphical classfiers like message passing algorithm and graph convolutional neural network against various kinds of adversarial examples.  
  **Resources** A [survey](https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.10528) from our lab on adversarial attack and defense on graph data, [KDD18 best paper](https://www.kixlab.org/courses/i2r/resource/review_paper/Adversarial_Attacks_on_neural_Networks_for_Graph_Data_Zugner.pdf) on adversarial attack on neural networks for graph data, [ICML18 paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.02371.pdf) on adversarial attack on graph structured data.
